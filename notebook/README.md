## Databricks Notebook

The proposed solution notebook is provided in this section. As mentioned earlier, all pipeline logic is unified within a single notebook to simplify the evaluation process, as well as to enable the local generation of the CDI interest rate table. The notebook is organized into sections, with each section implementing a specific part of the logic. Additionally, each cell includes comments that explain the operations being performed. The notebook also contains the results obtained after executing the commands.

As explained during the interview, the role involves migrating data tables and processing logic from Redshift to Databricks. Therefore, this solution was implemented using Databricks Community Edition.
