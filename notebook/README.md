## Databricks Notebook

The proposed solution notebook is provided in this section. As mentioned earlier, all pipeline logic is unified within a single notebook to simplify the evaluation process, as well as to enable the local generation of the CDI interest rate table. The notebook is organized into sections, with each section implementing a specific part of the logic. Additionally, each cell includes comments that explain the operations being performed. The notebook also contains the results obtained after executing the commands.

The documentation for the intermediate table can be found here [User Balance Table](https://github.com/gabrielsribe/RecargaPay-CDI-Bonus-Assignment/blob/user_balance_table/README.md)


The Databricks Community platform was used to develop the solution. Through the links below you can access and use the platform to run the notebook.
